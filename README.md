# PhotoFrame
A "smart" photo viewing application.
The program displays images stored in the PHOTO_DIR directory. Once a day the program downloads all photos from the Google Drive folder of your choice, into the PHOTO_DIR directory. This allows you to give the photo frame to a loved one, and then update the pictures on the frame remotely.
